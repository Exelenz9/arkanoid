## TODO

 - Allow selecting control panels colors
 - Allow setting players names
 - Allow changing panel size
 - Improve changing ball direction on hit to panel
 - Technical: use css animations instead of setting position via JS

## Know issues

 - The goal is probably counted a bit too early
 - Not possible to move two panels at the same time
